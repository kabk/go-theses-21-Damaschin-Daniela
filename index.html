  <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">I researched stairs, not as an object, but as a narrative seed of potential. My motivation was a simple curiosity about what
    stories can be constructed from an object deemed mundane, at least by me. Stairs was an intuitive choice, maybe random, but randomness is an asset considering
    what I set out to do. </span></p>
  <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">I started the research with broadening the chosen term as much as I could and then following as many associative paths as I could.
    All readings, curious facts, news articles I came across in the months of August to December were poured into the soup of other stories searching for links and
    narratives. Once an association was made, more reading and listening and associations in that direction followed. As a result there are many loose or thin threads
    left in the drafts. But more importantly, two sturdy, concluded, even interesting threads were woven.</span></p>

   <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">Rather than constructing a cohesive self-contained reality in words, this piece is meant to explore the worlds beyond mundanity:
     a sink, a faucet, a flight of stairs, and hopefully point out the abundance of dimensions an object can be regarded with.</span></p>
   <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">There is meaning in random connections and associations, there is value to not having a research question and not walking towards
     a goal, rather enjoying the space of transition and the abundance of possibilities. </span></p>
   <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">To showcase the two previous points I chose stairs as my focus point, all subsequent stories are at their core linked to the
     initial object, and all stories have come from free research and exploration without a traditional research question.</span>



       <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">Of course the absence of a research question that would narrow the field of interest already implies the presence of
         limitless possibility. Therefore I cannot address everything, the potential is, supposedly, infinite. So I will only cover the ground that I managed
         to organize into a solid narrative.</span></p>
       <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">I would casually call my thesis the sink and the faucet. Because like the first studio I rented, it has pretty much

         <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">I refuse to define &ldquo;stairs&rdquo; to preserve vagueness. I will squint my minds&rsquo; eye and see stairs in as broad
           of a sense as I can because vagueness gives stairs the most narrative potential. Let me take you on a side trip to explain exactly why I think vagueness holds power.</span></p>
         <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">Dragons are a grandiose cross-cultural phenomenon in human folklore, from the Chinese Lung to the Vedic Vritra, Slavic Zmey, Aztec Quetzalcoatl,
           and many others, it seems to be inevitable that a civilization encounters this beast. So what is it about dragons that human nature is so compelled to remember them, to imagine
           them, to pass on their story? An essay on that topic might start with a definition, but I would like you, the reader, to imagine a dragon for yourself. Now. If you grew up in a
           western society with Disney movies and Arthurian Legends the dragon you saw in your mind might be the one I call knemesis, a knight&#39;s nemesis, and it is probably big, green, scaly, winged, and breathes fire. Equally likely it is for a dragon to be exactly none of those things. Any dragon you came up with within your mind, is very likely to have a counterpart, a &quot;dragon&quot; described in a different myth with exactly the opposite physical attributes. Morally a dragon could be evil, a mortal danger as the biblical sea serpent Leviathan mentioned in the Old Testament.</span>

           <sup class="ft" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

           <span class="flowtext">&nbsp;Or it might be a benevolent sky-god like the Australian aboriginal Rainbow Serpent who is regarded by some tribes as the supreme healer, the one
             that blessed humankind with blood and who is responsible for blood flow.</span>

             <sup class="ft" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>

             <span class="flowtext">&nbsp;The Rainbow Serpent is a morally good creature. A dragon can as well be anywhere in between good and evil. There is an abundance of them and therefore
               a moral spectrum.</span></p>
         <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">Anthropologist David E. Jones wrote the book &ldquo;An Instinct for Dragons&rdquo; that argues the pancultural presence of dragons has to do
           with an amalgamation of predators: raptors, great cats, pythons, etc. by hominids into a beast that became a part of the human psyche.</span>

            <sup class="ft" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>

           <span class="flowtext">&nbsp;However the book received a very passionate negative review:</span>
           <span class="quote">&ldquo;One is tempted to say, as Dorothy Parker once did, that this is a book not to be tossed aside lightly but thrown violently. But no, it is not worth spending
             even that much energy on.&rdquo;</span>
             <span class="flowtext">&nbsp;by Paul Jordan-Smith who points out the lack of evidence and high amount of neglect and speculation in the previously mentioned book.</span>

               <span class="flowtext">&rdquo; Daniel Ogden brings up Jones&rsquo; theory and also points out the lack of a system for choosing
                 the imagery and narratives compiled as evidence. In his introduction Ogden explains what creatures exactly he will be
                 exploring, but also points out most creatures are categorized as dragons from an outside perspective:
                 &ldquo;The focal subject matter is not defined [...] by an etic &lsquo;dragon&rsquo; concept arbitrarily imposed from
                 without ...&rdquo;</span>

                 <span class="flowtext">&nbsp;I&#39;d like to propose that another reason</span>
                 <span class="flowtext">&nbsp;&ldquo;dragons&rdquo; so widespread is because so many different beings are categorized as
                   &ldquo;dragons&rdquo;, at least Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica both have a wide variety of creatures under the
                   term dragon. </span>

     <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">A unicorn can only be a horse with a horn, any deviation to form that morphology, and the creature
       is no longer a unicorn. Dragons however ... is it a vaguely serpent being? You have probably got yourself a dragon. One head,
       three or twelve, wings or no wings&mdash;irrelevant. &quot;Vaguely&quot; is the cornerstone of my definition. Vagueness is what
       gives the symbol of the dragon its remarkable potential. </span></p>

     <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">I invite you to think of stairs, the ones you went down yesterday to take out the trash, the ones
       you walked up to get to the office, the ones you walk up to get into an airplane, the ones that seem to break physics. Think of
       the amphitheater, is it not a concentric stair structure? And are the pyramids not four-sided stair structures? Why do we call
       advancement in our work-life climbing the career ladder? How does the DNA structure itself? How do we construct our social
       structures? Just like dragons, stairs are a wide reaching plot device that will hopefully string together the pieces I intend
       to write. In this occasionally coherent piece of writing, I will be talking about stairs, stairs do not inherently have a direction,
       neither does my thesis. You are free to continue with whatever chapter you wish.</span></p>

       and let it drip down to form a pile, and, if the mud is just right, the child can make piles upon piles that resemble castles,
       but each separate pile is somewhat of a cone, somewhat of a pyramid. Ancient Pyramids can be found across the globe, and they
       are a well-defined shape. Why are pyramids all across the globe? I don&#39;t need to make it make sense, it already does. You
       put stone on stone, and if you want to build something tall, yet stable, make the most out of the least construction materials,
       the pyramid is intuitively the shape of choice. </span></p>

     <p class="txt"><span class="flowtext">The term is notably nuanced by Victor Turner who expands upon the work of Arnold van Gennep.
       The latter is the person who created the concept of &ldquo;rites of passages&rdquo; describing them in his namesake publication
       as having three distinct stages: separation, transition, initiation. Turner defines liminality as occurring in the transitional stage.
       Even though a rite of passage is in itself a transitional process there is a moment within the transition when liminality occurs,
       where the subject is in Turner&#39;s words &ldquo;in social limbo&rdquo;, completely ostracized. This initial description deals
       with spaces of transition in life, in social terms, it can describe the transition from youth to adulthood, or a divorce, or moving
       your place of living.</span>

       Department of Planning. But theirs are not the afterlife&rsquo;s only theological zoning laws. Zoroastrians teach the existence of

       transitional state between death and reincarnation. In Islam, there is barzakh (from the Persian for &ldquo;barrier,&rdquo; or
       &ldquo;partition&rsquo;), an interstitial period spent between death and Bihar al-Anwar, the Day of Judgement.&rdquo;</span>

           apathy. Their terror comes from eternity, there will be no rest, and nothing except the mist. Similarly in Vietnam there is the

       of a larger network of movement, it is a place concerned with identity. At every full transit through an airport from entry to exit at
       some point a judgement of identity will occur. The person will take out their identity card, another person will assess whether the
       traveller is allowed to continue with their journey and exit this transitional space.</span></p>

       When his documents were sorted out he voluntarily chose to remain. His prolonged, but ultimately temporary stay at the airport ended when,

      &ldquo;limitless&rdquo; potential, it cannot be encompassed. There are many other stories that could have happened, there are more
      chapters sketched out, attempted, thought of, about Madonna, celebrity culture, escalators, the first burglar alarm, Victorian stairs
      of death and many other anecdotes saved under the folder simply named stairs. But my inability to gather it all, think of everything

     not because people have not tried to ride them. Domesticating zebras for human use would be
     very useful in regions they are native to not only because of their physical proximity but also
     due to their resilience to local diseases fatal to horses.The visual similarity to horses is
     right there, but behaviourally the similarity does not translate. They are easily stressed and
     scared. Worse, in a flight of fight situation opposing a human the zebra is likely to choose fight.
     Walter Rothschild famously arrived at Buckingham Palace in a carriage drawn by zebras, and there
     are other examples of individual specimens who were tamed. However, this success does not replicate
     to a process or to a larger scale. Source: Safaris, Thomson. &ldquo;Wild Horses Can&#39;t
